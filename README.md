# digit-recognizer
Digit recognition based on the classical Mnist dataset for Kaggle competition.  
This is an experimental notebook to test several Neural Networks, classical or convolutional.  
I am using Tensorflow 2 with the Keras interface.

Best score so far in the competition: **97.971%** accuracy with CNN.

Data available on Kaggle as it is quite heavy.
